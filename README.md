**SUMMARY:**

- My Econ PhD job market paper (2012) is about the use of emergency departments (ERs) for non-urgent care, and how demand for ERs is affected by the establishment of new community health centers (CHCs).
- Over-utilization of emergency rooms is one of a major problems in the US healthcare system. It leads to congestion, delays in care, medical mistakes and worse health outcomes.
- One reason for why over-utilization exists is because people may have poor access to regular sources of primary care.
- **What I do:** I focus on community health centers or clinics that provide free or discounted primary care to low-income groups.
- **The main question that I ask is:** When a new community health center opens up, does it reduce the use of emergency rooms for non-urgent care.
- And the short answer is **yes,** especially by patients who do not have a health insurance.


- What is important to note is that the clinics sector has been rapidly expanding in recent years as a result of increased levels of federal funding. There has been a lot of variation mainly due to clinic entry, and also occasional exits and relocations. So, to answer my question about the impact of health centers on emergency rooms, I take advantage of this recent growth in the clinics sector.
- Specifically, I use **two main datasets from California:** The first dataset allows me to track annual changes in the number of operational clinics between 2006 and 2010 (as well as changes in the staffing of clinics and their utilization). And the second dataset lets me analyze emergency room visits by the patient’s zip code, gender, race and other characteristics.
- Most of the previous research on community health centers is based on cross-sectional comparisons of areas with and without clinics. This is problematic because the two types of areas are fundamentally different: Areas with clinics generally tend to have higher poverty rates.
- **What I do: I use **two empirical strategies to estimate the causal impact of clinics on the use of emergency departments.**
- **My first strategy** controls for all permanent differences across zip codes and estimates the effect of clinics within a zip code. I find that one additional clinic reduces the number of uninsured ER visits by about 1.3% in zip codes within a 5-mile radius of the clinic (semi-annually).

Here, while I account for all permanent differences across zip codes, I also check whether other factors that change over time may potentially affect my estimates, and they seem not too.
- To check the robustness of my results in the first strategy, I also propose a **second identification strategy (diff-in-diff)** where I exploit the quasi-experimental structure in my data that allows me to separate patients into treatment and control groups based on their proximity to a major highway.
 Why is this a reasonable strategy? Well, it looks like we can think of these health centers as making an entry decision in two stages: First, they must identify a poor, high-need area where to locate in order to qualify for government grants. Second, I also note that within their chosen catchment area, clinics tend to locate closer to a major highway, perhaps due to convenience considerations or

infrastructure constraints. And I use this differential proximity to a major highway to model the patients’ level of access to community health centers.
 Specifically, I define patients in highway-adjacent areas as my treatment group and patients in the nearby but more highway-removed areas as my control group, and compare the number of ED visits in the two groups before and after a clinic entry.
o We would normally be concerned about any fundamental differences between treatment and control areas.
 But what is important for my second identification strategy is the assumption that emergency room use in treatment and control areas would evolve similarly over time in the absence of the clinic entry. Then, I can use temporal variation in the control group as a counter-factual for what would have happened in the treatment group (in the absence of the clinic entry). I do a few robustness checks to examine the validity of this assumption, including a placebo test in areas with no clinic entry. And it seems to hold.
What I find is:
 First, the number of ER visits by uninsured patients declines by about 10% as a result of the clinic entry between 2006 and 2010. [this is roughly a reduction of 2.5% semi-annually, which I show to be consistent with my estimates in the first strategy].
 Second, the overall decline in ER visits is driven primarily by uninsured men. One explanation for this could be that women can get a certain amount of primary care services at family planning clinics, which also provide a lot of subsidized health services.
 Third, I find no impact of community health centers on the emergency room use by patients with private insurance or public health insurance such as Medicaid.
 My estimates also imply that hospitals save between 6 to 16 cents in ER expenditure on charity care per each dollar of investment in clinics.
 And this is only for ER visits that don’t end up in a hospital admission and that get averted as a result of the clinic entry.
 Here, I do not account for people who choose not to use ERs for non-urgent care but who might benefit from improved access to primary care. We also expect clinics to improve health outcomes for their patients, prevent chronic conditions, provide continuity of care, and decrease the number of hospital admissions.
 To sum up, community health centers seem to induce uninsured patients to substitute away from emergency rooms, especially in the case of non-life-threatening, non-urgent medical conditions.
 The lack of response by Medicaid patients requires further study. It suggests that we potentially could generate more cost-savings by making clinics more appealing to this group of patients, or by changing Medicaid reimbursement schemes.
